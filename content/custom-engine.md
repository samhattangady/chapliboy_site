Using a custom engine to create a game is sometimes discouraged. People highlight
a whole host of reasons why it is a bad idea. So I thought I could talk a bit
about some reasons why it is a _good_ idea. Or atleast, why it was a good idea
for _me_.

I used a custom engine to develop
[Konkan Coast Pirate Solutions](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2156410/Konkan_Coast_Pirate_Solutions/).

It is a cozy puzzle game about helping pirate ships do pirate things. It's out on
1st March. [Wishlist now](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2156410/Konkan_Coast_Pirate_Solutions/).

So here's 7 reasons why I chose to use a custom engine to make my game.
