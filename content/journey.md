I just released
[Konkan Coast Pirate Solutions](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2156410/Konkan_Coast_Pirate_Solutions/).

It is a cozy puzzle game about helping pirate ships do pirate things. [It's out on Steam now](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2156410/Konkan_Coast_Pirate_Solutions/).

So here's how I the game evolved from the initial idea.
