The first thing you see of a game is a visual. 
A gif on reddit, a clip on tiktok.
Some snippet of some video essay.
A thumbnail on steam.
And if they're on your steam page,
the trailer and screenshots better not disappoint...
that's what decides if you're getting a wishlist.
That's just how it goes...

So when it came to my game, 
It was challenge I would face at some point or the other.

I am working on 
[Konkan Coast Pirate Solutions](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2156410/Konkan_Coast_Pirate_Solutions/).

It is a cozy puzzle game about helping pirate ships do pirate things. It's out on
1st March. [Wishlist now](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2156410/Konkan_Coast_Pirate_Solutions/).

So here's how I went about breaking down artstyles for games.
