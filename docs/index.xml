      <description>Using a custom engine to create a game is sometimes discouraged. People highlight a whole host of reasons why it is a bad idea. So I thought I could talk a bit about some reasons why it is a good idea. Or atleast, why it was a good idea for me.
I used a custom engine to develop Konkan Coast Pirate Solutions.
It is a cozy puzzle game about helping pirate ships do pirate things.</description>

      <description>I love Stephen Sausage Roll.
It was the first puzzle game that I played, and it will always be the gold standard for me. It was brutally difficult at times. Just manoeuvring around the levels can be difficult, and my playthrough spread out over more than a year. I would face a difficult puzzle, break my head over it for a while, and be completely stuck. Then I would take a long break.</description>
