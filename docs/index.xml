      <description>I sometimes forget that games consists of many different fields, and in the best of cases, the final product is more than the sum of its parts.
I generally consider myself involved in the fields of a systems-design and programming. So whenever I spot problems while making my games, I tend to use those as my hammers. It is often only after a whole lot of hammering, and sufficient metaphorical smashed thumbs do I remember a fundamental truth; There are more tools than my favored hammers.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been almost a year, and I&amp;rsquo;ve done a lot more game design and feel like I have a bit more to share about the choice I make to write my own engine as opposed to using one that has already been constructed for me.

      <title>Evolution of an Idea</title>

      <description>I had an idea. And I was convinced that it was the greatest idea ever idead.
In three words: Zachtronics&amp;hellip; but ants!
 Here&amp;rsquo;s the premise. In a colony of ants, a single ant has a very basic set of instructions that it follows. A finite set of &amp;ldquo;states&amp;rdquo; that it can be in and a few methods of interacting with other ants in the colony. But when you have thousands of ants following the same ruleset, something emerges that is greater than the sum of its parts.</description>

      <description>Konkan Coast Pirate Solutions released on the 1st of March 2023. It&amp;rsquo;s been a few months now, and I thought it might be time to look back at the game, and analyse some of the decisions that I chose to make.
&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp NOTE: I am incredibly proud of how the game has come out. I feel like I pushed to the best of my abilities. For what it aims to be, the game does a great job.</description>

So here&amp;rsquo;s the subtle aspects of puzzle game design.

      <description>The first thing you see of a game is a visual. A gif on reddit, a clip on tiktok. Some snippet of some video essay. A thumbnail on steam. And if they&amp;rsquo;re on your steam page, the trailer and screenshots better not disappoint&amp;hellip; that&amp;rsquo;s what decides if you&amp;rsquo;re getting a wishlist. That&amp;rsquo;s just how it goes&amp;hellip;
So when it came to my game, It was challenge I would face at some point or the other.</description>

      <description>Using a custom engine to create a game is sometimes discouraged. People highlight a whole host of reasons why it is a bad idea. So I thought I could talk a bit about some reasons why it is a good idea. Or atleast, why it was a good idea for me.
I used a custom engine to develop Konkan Coast Pirate Solutions.
It is a cozy puzzle game about helping pirate ships do pirate things.</description>

      <title>Puzzle Games and Difficulty</title>

      <description>I love Stephen Sausage Roll.
It was the first puzzle game that I played, and it will always be the gold standard for me. It was brutally difficult at times. Just manoeuvring around the levels can be difficult, and my playthrough spread out over more than a year. I would face a difficult puzzle, break my head over it for a while, and be completely stuck. Then I would take a long break.</description>
